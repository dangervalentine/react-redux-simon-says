 * The app bar: mark, wordmark, credit. Same two parts in the same order and
 * the same credit line as the sibling projects wear, so they read as a set.
 *
 * The mark is decorative — `alt=""` rather than a description — because the
 * title it sits beside already says the app's name, and a screen reader
 * announcing "Simon Says logo, Simon Says" is worse than announcing it once.
